I've just read this great blog:

- [Get on the same page with user story mapping](https://yellowpencil.com/blog/get-on-the-same-page-with-user-story-mapping/)

## Notes and Highlights

How does user story mapping work?

- Get people working on the project involved
- Who are the different people using the product?
- Talk about about how the product works
- Identify the activities and steps within each activity
- Write down the details within each step
- Organize stories into releases
