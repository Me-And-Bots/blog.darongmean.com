I've just watched this great video by Jesper Boeg:

- [Getting Real Value out of your Planning Efforts with Story Mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4_PvSXZssc)

## Notes and Highlights

Story mapping in short:

- create product vision
- identify "backbone" activities
- identify target groups/user segments
- walk the "backbone" with each role
- prioritize (walking skeleton, release goal)

A vision is important, if applicable try this format for vision statement:

**FOR** (target for the product)

**WHO** (users' needs)

**OUR PRODUCT IS** (the product category)

**THAT** (major benefit, key functionalities)

**UNLIKE** (current practice, competition)

**OUR PRODUCT** (major differentiator)
