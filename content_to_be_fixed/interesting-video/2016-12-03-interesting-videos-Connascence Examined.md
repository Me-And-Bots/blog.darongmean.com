I've just watched this great video by Jim Weirich:

## Notes and Highlights

Connascence (noun) is defined as 

1. the common birth of two or more at the same tome; production of two or more together, 
1. that which is born or produced with another, or
1. the act of growing together.

In software, connascence is a rough measurement of the amount of coupling amount the components of a software system. Components that are "born" together will often need to change together over time. Excessive connascence in our software means that the system is hard to change and hard to maintain.
