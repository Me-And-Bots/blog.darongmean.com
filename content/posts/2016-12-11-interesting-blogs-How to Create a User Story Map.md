I've just read this great blog:

- [How to Create a User Story Map](http://www.payton-consulting.com/how-to-create-a-user-story-map/)

## Notes and Highlights

- Step 1:  Outline the major goals (epics).
- Step 2:  For each epic, outline the user flow from beginning to end.
- Step 3:  For each theme, outline and prioritize the user stories associated with that theme.
