I've just read this great blog:

- [User story mapping](https://rthewitt.com/2015/12/05/user-story-mapping/)

## Notes and Highlights

- Can this be applied to any type of product?

I think so. Provided it has end users. I’ve applied the technique to a feature which allowed users to sync their favourite items. On the surface of it, the feature was essentially a read/write capability – but we were able to convey it as a set of user tasks.

- Would you ever create multiple user story maps for one product?

I have never done this. If your product is the Amazon website then you may need multiple maps – but hopefully your product isn’t that large.

- Are there any downsides?

The user story map doesn’t replace your requirements/JIRA tickets. It’s essentially a way to visualise them within the context of the roadmap. As the system changes you’ll need to update the USM as well as your requirements/JIRA. As such, it’s a product artefact that needs maintaining.

- What if you have no idea what the product is?

The technique generally assumes there is a product vision around which to hang these tasks/stories. If you have very little idea about the new product (e.g. “we want to build a page on the website where users can see things that most interest them”) then you can still use this technique. I’d recommend some form of upfront thought about what you want that page to do by the product team & a warm up activity for the group before step 2 (e.g. crazy 8’s).

- Aren’t user tasks just another type of user story?

User tasks can be thought of as high-level user stories e.g. “searching for a product“ is a task that can include multiple user stories (search by keyword, search by shoe size, filter by brand, search by colour). The essence of activities vs tasks vs stories is that they’re hierarchical user needs. Exactly what they are depends on what product you build.
