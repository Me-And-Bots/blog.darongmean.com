I've just read this great blog:

- [Functional Mumbo Jumbo - ADTs](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/functional-mumbo-jumbo-adts.html)

## Notes and Highlights

- What's a product type?

Product types you'll be deeply familiar with - it's when you make a new type by combining others. For example, you could define a `Person` type as the combination of a `String` for their name, and an `Int` for their age. 

- What's a sum type?

Well, product types are a bit like an `AND` operation, aren't they? They `AND` types together. If you think of it that way, you're instantly going to start to wonder what an `OR` would look like.

...It's an exclusive-or, as a type.
