I've just read this great blog:

- [Splitting user stories -- the hamburger method](https://gojko.net/2012/01/23/splitting-user-stories-the-hamburger-method/)

## Notes and Highlights

Problems: Story is too big to split and estimate; business users donâ€™t accept any breakdown proposed by the delivery team; team is inexperienced and thinks about technical splitting only;new project starts and no simple starting stories can be found

Solution: User Story Hamburger

- Step 1: Identify tasks
- Step 2: Identify options for tasks
- Step 3: Combine results
- Step 4: Trim the hamburger
- Step 5: Take the first bite
- Step 6: Take another bite... and continue
