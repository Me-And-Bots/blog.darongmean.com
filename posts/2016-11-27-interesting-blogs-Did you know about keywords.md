I've just read this great blog:

- [Did you know about ::keywords?](https://kotka.de/blog/2010/05/Did_you_know_III.html)

## Notes and Highlights

- ...the double-colon form also allows for aliases! So all we have to do is set up a suitable alias for the namespace and we can save some serious typing.
