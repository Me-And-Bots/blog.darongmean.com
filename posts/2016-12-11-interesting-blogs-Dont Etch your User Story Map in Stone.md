I've just read this great blog:

- [Don't Etch your User Story Map in Stone](http://winnipegagilist.blogspot.ca/2013/06/dont-etch-your-user-story-map-in-stone.html)

## Notes and Highlights

Whether you are working on a startup or an enterprise project, you begin with a list of questions or assumptions. Here are some examples: 

- Will anyone use it?
- Will anyone pay?
- Does anyone care?
- How will we make $?
- Can we build it?
- Do we understand the problem?
- Will this solve the problem?
- Will it perform adequately?
- Will it integrate with other applications successfully?
- Can we build this with the budget & schedule we have?
- What is the best architecture for this project?

When you build and prioritize your map, you should be doing so with these questions in mind. As you resolve each of those questions, your map should change.
