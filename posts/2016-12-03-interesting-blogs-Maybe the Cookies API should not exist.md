I've just read this great blog:

- [Maybe the Cookies API should not exist](http://tech.noredink.com/post/147676730053/maybe-the-cookies-api-should-not-exist)

## Notes and Highlights

- As far as I can tell, the only usage that really makes sense is the following scenario:
> A user comes to your website http://mail.example.com and you want to serve them their inbox immediately, no sign in necessary.

- Based on a unique identifier, you can look up things like theme from your database and send back the appropriately styled HTML. Basically, **any other information can be derived from a unique ID.**
