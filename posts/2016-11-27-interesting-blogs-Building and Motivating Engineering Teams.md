I've just read this great blog:

- [Building and Motivating Engineering Teams](https://medium.com/@skamille/building-and-motivating-engineering-teams-24fd56910039#.xsmtfnqun)


## Notes and Highlights

- Respect that engineers are smart individuals who often have more to add to your business than just their coding talents, and teach them to respect that the other parts of the business have equally valuable skills and perspectives. Engineers donâ€™t need to feel like the company royalty to be inspired to do good work, but they do need the opportunity to be treated like a partner.
